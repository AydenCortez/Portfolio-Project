        <p id="delveText1">The Delve Homes project required students to build a website meant to advertise and showcase the subterranean living service Delve Homes. It was a major beginning project for me and my partner to show that we were decent enough at HTML and CSS. The project was created in Visual Studio code and hosted with Netlify.</p>
        <p id="delveText2">I learned how to create basic effects for both images and the navigation bar. We also learned to use a singular style sheet for all pages and learned to organize the classes and IDs. Most of our challenges came in the form of design flaws or issues. The main one being the lack of consistent spacing between the elements. This was later fixed, however, with the help of sources. I can confidently say that my partner and I learned collaboration skills throughout the project as it was the first major group project we had.
