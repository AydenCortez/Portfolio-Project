        <p id="starText1">Our most recent and ambitious project was that of an online board game. As a group project, we had to create an online board game as an original concept or a modification of an existing one. Starmageddon is a board game based on the household game, “The game of LIFE”. We actually found it quite boring as a board game, so we made a few tweaks to increase the level of action and difficulty of the game. This was done with a simple incremental difficulty mechanic where it gets harder the longer the game is played.</p>
        <p id="starText2">This was one of the more advanced and visual websites I have completed, and I learned a very large amount of JavaScript from it. I found it to be a big jump from a simple calculator. However, it was my favorite project to date and I had a lot of fun designing and coding it.
