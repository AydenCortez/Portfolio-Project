    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img src="images/aydenC1.jpg" alt="">
    <p class="aboutText" id="aboutText">My name is Ayden Cortez, an aspiring web developer, student, brother, and son. I’ve always been someone to love building something, whether it be code, a crafts project, or even LEGOs. Looking back at work that I've done and thinking that, “I made this” is my favorite part of it.  As a job, I've always wanted to do something in the tech field. While the specific job has changed over time, the premise has stayed the same. To further improve this aspect, I'm taking a web development class here at CART. My experience here has been great and it has a very professional atmosphere. I look forward to the next few years as I learn the skills and progress a chapter in my life. To illustrate my career, I've created this portfolio, so feel free to check it out and contact me!</p>
    <h2>What I Like</h2>
    <p class="aboutText" id="hobbiesText">
        I've done a lot of hobbies as a kid, whether it be because I liked it or due to a trend. I used to read a lot as I read the entire Harry Potter, Hunger games, and Maze Runner series of books. The biggest interest of all however was LEGOs. I loved building LEGOs whether it was from a set or my imagination. I still have my bin of LEGOs to this day. Nowadays, my hobbies mostly consist of computer things like dabbling into different coding languages. I find it fun to do different small projects that use unfamiliar languages, for the sake of learning a small portion of them.

    <h2>My Future</h2>
    <p class="aboutText" id="futureText">After high school, I plan to go to college to further my education in a computer science major. A computer science major can cover many different parts of the field which makes my choices for a job much more broad. From the colleges I've looked at, I have narrowed my choices to a few colleges. Some notable ones include Cal Poly, USC, and UCLA.</p>
