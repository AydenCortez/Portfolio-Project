    <h1 class="projectTitle">Internet Botting</h1>
    <section class="projectDesc">
        <p id="bottingText1">The Internet Botting project was a project where we got to choose one developing event in recent technology and had to create a research website for it. For this project, I chose to research the rise of internet bots. I believe this was a relevant topic because it can affect most facets of social media in both a positive and negative way.</p>
        <p id="bottingText2">For the project, I decided to not go over the top with the decoration as it was also meant to be a research paper. I wanted to have a modest theme with my website. It featured very basic text effects that I learned to do while making the project as well as a customized sidebar and scrollbar. The project was created in Visual Studio code and hosted with Netlify. I definitely learned perseverance with this project as I encountered challenges that left me slightly frustrated such as the responsive design for mobile phones.
