    <h1 class="projectTitle">Budget Calculator</h1>
    <section class="projectDesc">
        <p id="calcText1">As an introduction to JavaScript, we were tasked with creating a budget calculator. The calculator featured a monthly income calculator and taxes calculator. This calculator was simply meant to be our first JavaScript project and the styling was kept to a minimum. The calculator featured JavaScript actions such as real time calculations and commas being placed automatically (yes, you have to code that in).</p>
        <p id="calcText2">This calculator, like the rest, was coded in Visual Studio Code and was hosted on Netlify. It was definitely a learning experience with JavaScript, and I can  say that curiosity was the theme of the project. I was just learning the capabilities of the JavaScript programming language.
